The tornado formed east of Roy Davis Road and lifted just east of Short Track Road. Several  houses experienced roof damage with greater than 20% loss along with a pickup truck that tipped over. One single family residence had significant roof loss, but walls remained intact. This prompted the rating of a high-end EF-1.","Supercells erupted during the late afternoon and early evening hours in northern Mississippi and spread east across north Alabama during the rest of the evening into the overnight hours.  At least one tornado was determined to produce damage in northern Madison County near New Market. Other reports of damaging winds were reported. The other impact from this evening was excessive rainfall and flash flooding. A band of 3-6 inch rainfall occurred from northwest into north central Alabama, resulting in several area creeks and small streams going into flood.",7

On the east side of Highway 431, near the Lincoln Road intersection, numerous structures were heavily damaged including multiple stores which sustained major damage. This includes a collapse of walls and roofs displaced with debris thrown eastward. Given the degree of damage at this location, a mid-range EF-3 rating was reported. The tornado tracked east-northeast through Mulberry Road. Along this path, the tornado uprooted and snapped numerous trees and caused significant roof damage to a single-family home. Unfortunately, the tornado continued to intensify on route to Borderline Road which is along the Alabama and Tennessee state line. At this location, heavy damage was noted where houses were damaged and two homes experienced a complete collapse of walls, destroying the structures. One fatality was reported at a single-family home along Borderline Road where the structure was destroyed. In addition, HEMSI reported five injuries, three of which were transported to the hospital with critical injuries and two were treated on scene with minor injuries.","As part of a larger regional outbreak of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes on March 31st into April 1st, a band of thunderstorms, many of them supercellular, pushed east across north Alabama and southern middle Tennessee during the early morning hours of the 1st.

Sporadic tree damage was noted along Masters Drive, Augusta Trace, and Hampton Cove Way into the main entrance of the neighborhood on the Bypass. Trees were snapped and uprooted at this location near the waterfall at the entrance to the subdivision, and tornado width was estimated at about 40 yards. From here, the tornado continued southeast across mainly rural portions of the golf course as it approached Old Highway 431 heading to Cherry Tree. Trees were downed at the ball fields at this location, before the tornado strengthened as it approached homes further down Cherry Tree Road. A home suffered damage when trees were blown down onto the structure, as well as trees snapped near the bases at this location. The tornado was at its strongest at this location, with 93 mph wind speeds and a width of 50 yards as it snapped the trees about 2-5 feet from their bases. From this point, the tornado produced sporadic tree damage following Goose Creek along Cherry Tree Road.

The tornado damaged more trees in the Highland Lakes neighborhood, on the east-facing slope of Rainbow Mountain. Numerous trees were uprooted in this area with a snapped trunk of at least one weaker, softwood tree. This damage indicator was reduced to account for the condition of the tree. The tornado then continued eastward across Slaughter Road. More trees were uprooted along Mingo Road. Minor damage was observed in the Creekwood neighborhood and into the Indian Creek basin where the tornado lifted.","A significant outbreak of tornadoes occurred in two waves during the evening of the 8th and early morning hours of the 9th.

North of Dug Hill Estates, the tornado continued to uproot hardwood trees and snapped a cedar tree before moving eastward along the southern facing slope of the adjacent ridge. Just to the east of the ridge along Dug Hill Road, hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted. Snapped trees were observed along the relatively steep sloped southern portion of Watson Grande Way. The tornado then tracked generally east into McMullen Cove and continued to distribute leaf litter and snap small branches before beginning to peel some siding on single family homes. The tornado then intensified and caused partial uplift of roofs on the eastern side to four houses on Kenhurst Lane SE.
