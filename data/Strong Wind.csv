Sustained wind speeds of 25-35 mph gusted frequently from 40-55 mph at times. One individual was killed while picking up debris in their yard after the line of thunderstorms. A utility worker was electrocuted while working to restore power and was transported to a hospital. Additional power poles and lines were knocked down, but it is too difficult to determine exact numbers separated from the severe thunderstorms. Thus, those numbers are posted within the severe thunderstorm entry for this day.","A prolonged damaging gradient wind event combined with an intense squall line during the daylight hours of the 3rd to produce widespread wind damage and impacts to the region. Numerous power outages resulted from power poles being snapped and power lines being brought down.  All told, thousands were without power in north Alabama for at least for a couple of hours, and in some cases lasting into the next two to three days. Hundreds of reports of trees or limbs being knocked down were received, in many cases on homes, vehicles and other structures. Sadly, two people were killed outside their homes from fallen trees while picking up debris after the line of thunderstorms went through and additional high winds developed.  Other minor injuries were also reported including one utility worker who was working to restore power.||A powerful low pressure system intensified rapidly as it moved northeast from Texas through Arkansas, southeast Missouri into western Kentucky.  In doing so, very windy conditions developed across the Tennessee Valley ahead of an associated cold front and squall line. South winds increased to 35-45 mph, with gusts of 55-60 mph at times. An intense squall line moved in from Mississippi during the mid morning hours, sweeping east across the rest of the area through the midday hours. Peak wind gusts of 50-60 mph were reported frequently, with one gust up to 77 mph at Pryor Field in Decatur (Morgan County) and 69 mph at the Huntsville International Airport (Madison County). Also, at least two tornadoes were spawned by the line in Jackson County.  Behind the line of thunderstorms, the sky cleared out rapidly, but southwest winds intensified as well, with 35-45 mph sustained winds, gusting at 55-65 mph. The winds finally subsided quickly near sunset, but not after additional damage occurred.",14

Based upon a photo, the home sustained significant damage to the roof and home on its northeast side facing the tree.","Strong and gusty southeast non-thunderstorm or pressure gradient winds developed as a wave of showers and thunderstorms moved through the region. Frequent gusts of 40 to 50 mph were observed, resulting in numerous trees being knocked down in a few areas of north Alabama.

Madison County Lake decided to close early due to the number of trees down. A tree fell onto a car in southeast Huntsville, collapsing its rear passenger compartment. The winds also peeled metal roofing off of a restaurant in downtown Madison. As many as 7,000 utility customers lost power during the event.","Windy conditions developed during the late morning and midday hours as Tropical Depression Francine lifted northward through central and northern Mississippi.  East to southeast winds increased to 25-35 mph with frequent gusts of 40-50 mph.  The winds knocked down numerous trees and tree limbs throughout north Alabama and southern middle Tennessee, impacting several power lines and inducing power outages affecting tens of thousands.  A few trees fell on vehicles.  No injuries have been reported.",235
